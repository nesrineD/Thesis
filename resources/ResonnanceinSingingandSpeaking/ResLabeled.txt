It has been said that breathing is singing, this statement is equally applicable to speaking. [breathing, singing]. Without properly controlled breathing the best singing or speaking tone cannot be produced, for tone is but vocalized breath. [breathing, tone, vocal]. Hence in the cultivation of the voice, breathing is the first function to receive attention. [voice, breathing]. For singer or speaker, the correct use of the breathing apparatus determines the question of success or failure. [breathing, success]. For a voice user, therefore, the first requisite is a well-developed chest, the second, complete control of it. [voice, chest]. It must not be supposed that a singer's breathing is something strange or complex, for it is nothing more than an amplification of normal, healthy breathing. [singing, breathing]. In contrast, however, to the undisciplined casual breathing of the general public, the singer is a professional breather. [singing, breathing]. There are two sets of respiratory muscles, one for inspiration and another for expiration, twenty two or more in all. [respiration, muscles]. The principal muscles of inspiration are the diaphragm and the intercostal muscles that elevate the ribs. [inspiration, muscle]. The chief muscles of expiration are the four sets of abdominal muscles and the intercostal muscles that depress the ribs. [expiration, muscle]. The correctly trained singer or speaker will never allow the breath power to be exhausted. [practice, breath, strain]. Some breath should be taken in at every convenient interval between the words, according to the punctuation, but never between syllables of a word, this is correct phrasing. [breath, phrasing]. In this way the lungs are kept nearly full, and breathing is at its best. [lungs, good, breath]. The chief cause of breath exhaustion is wasted breath. [breath, exhaustion]. This waste comes from exhaling more breath than the tone requires, and breath that does not become tone is wasted. [breath, expiration, amount, tone]. This fault is largely induced by lack of proper resonance adjustment. [resonance, adjustement]. The singer should always feel able to sing another note or to speak another word. [singer]. To sing or speak thirty or forty counts with one breath is useful practice but poor performance. [singing, breath, practice].
