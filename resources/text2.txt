Meaningful collaboration between people and machines must not subvert human creativity, feeling and questioning over speed, profit and efficiency. [collaboration,people,machines,creativity]. When I think about the future of human-machine interactions, two entwined anxieties come to mind. [future,interaction,entities]. First, there is the tension between individual and collective existence. [tension,existence]. Technology connects us to each other as never before, and in doing so makes explicit the degree to which we are defined and anticipated by others. [technology,connection,definition]. the ways in which our ideas and identities do not simply belong to us, but are part of a larger human ebb and flow. [identities,ownership]. This has always been true – but rarely has it been more evident or more constantly experienced. [truth]. For the first time in human history, the majority of the world’s population is not only literate – itself an achievement less than a century old – but also able to actively participate in written and recorded culture, courtesy of the connected devices pervading almost every country on earth. [history,population,literacy,connectedness]. This is an astonishing, disconcerting, delightful thing: the crowd in the cloud becoming a stream of shared consciousness. [astonishment,cloud,conciousness]. Second, there is the question of how we see ourselves. [question]. Human nature is a baggy, capacious concept, and one that technology has altered and extended throughout history. [nature,concept,history]. Digital technologies challenge us once again to ask what place we occupy in the universe. [challenge]. what it means to be creatures of language, self-awareness and rationality. [meaning]. Our machines aren’t minds yet, but they are taking on more and more of the attributes we used to think of as uniquely human. [machines,attributes, human]. reason, action, reaction, language, logic, adaptation, learning. [attribute]. Rightly, fearfully, falteringly, we are beginning to ask what transforming consequences this latest extension and usurpation will bring. [extension,consequences]. I call these anxieties entwined because, for me, they come accompanied by a shared error. [anxiety,combination]. the overestimation of our rationality and our autonomy. [anxiety,rationality]. In asking what it means to be human, we are prone to think of ourselves as individual, rational minds, and to describe our relationships with and through technology on this basis. [assumption,technology,mind]. as isolated “users” whose agency and freedom are a matter of skills and reasoned options. [qualification]. as task-performers who are existentially threatened by any more efficient agent. [competition]. The latest case came to light on Wednesday, when officials investigated a noodle shop in the city of Yulin in Shaanxi Province for adding poppy capsules to mutton noodles, Xinhua reported, citing a local newspaper. [investigation].
