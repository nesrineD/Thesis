first doc;"Photography has become pervasive in our society.  Each of us sees hundreds, if not thousands, of images every day. The vast majority of images are those taken for personal enjoyment. These images either capture the moment or provide a form of self-expression. Many other images are used to lubricate the wheels of commerce. They appear in ads and on magazine covers and packages. Other images in magazines and newspapers are used to convey news or to make an editorial point. No matter what purpose images are put to, it is the images themselves that are transcendent. The way they have been captured is secondary. However, changes in technology can open new opportunities and approaches that change the way images look. For example, the introduction of the 35mm Leica back in the 1930s made it easier to capture fast moving action and images became more spontaneous and fluid, a far cry from the more formally posed images required by much larger and more ackward cameras . The vast majority of the images you see are still captured with traditional cameras and film. However, this is changing rapidly as digital cameras are accepted in more and more areas of photography. . Already they have made major inroads into catalog photography and photojournalism.  They are now well on their way to becoming a major factor in photography for self-expression. In time, they are destined to dominate photography. Although photographic technology has changed dramatically since its invention in 1840, the principles of good images have remained fairly constant. The images taken in 1840 by Henry Fox Talbot and Daguarre are as well composed and interesting as any images taken with the most modern equipment. However, although technology doesn't make good images any easier to capture, it has made profound changes in others areas of photography.  Digital photography in particular has made it possible to capture an image and then instantly distribute it around the world. Digital photography has also closed the darkroom and opened up an entirely new way to edit and present images. A digital camera, a notebook computer, and a high-speed Internet connection makes each of us a node on an ever-expanding network of photographers and viewers. In this on-line book we explore photography in a very traditional way, but the emphasis is on modern technology from digital cameras, to digital darkrooms, to on-line publishing and sharing of images. This text provides an introduction to all aspects of the emerging world of digital photography. Starting with the camera and image capture, it then goes on the discuss image storage, transfer, editing, printing, and distribution. As you follow the path through the book you'll learn much about hardware, software, and procedures. In many ways teaching digital photography is much like teaching traditional photography. In traditional courses the end result is usually a print and the darkroom experience of creating it. In digital photography courses, a print is only one of many possible applications of a captured image. In many ways it's the least exciting aspect to students who are more oriented to the Internet and the possibilities it opens up to displaying and sharing images world-wide. It's this community aspect of digital photography that draws many students into courses they might not otherwise have taken.  As a teacher, the digital approach also makes it easier to demonstrate techniques and procedures on a one-to-one basis. A student who can preview results immediately can grasp ideas such as exposure compensation much easier and faster than a student who works in traditional media. It's this immediate feedback that shows students how the principles they are learning apply in situations of all kinds. Once captured, digital photographs are already in a universal format that makes them incredibly easy to distribute and use. For example, you can insert digital photographs into word processing documents, send them by e-mail to friends, or post them on a Web site where anyone in the world can see them. With many cameras you can immediately see your images on a small LCD screen on the back of the camera, or you can connect the camera to a TV and show them much like a slide show. Some cameras can even be connected to a microscope or telescope to display dramatically enlarged images on a large-screen TV.  Digital photography is instant photography without the film costs. In addition to distributing and displaying photographs, you can also use a photo-editing program such as Photoshop to improve or alter them. For example, you can crop them, remove red-eye, change colors or contrast, and even add and delete elements.  It?s like having a darkroom with the lights on and without the chemicals. If you?re considering going digital, here are a few more reasons to get even more serious. Going digital saves you money in the long run by not buying rolls of film and paying for their development. Digital cameras instantly show you how your pictures look. You can view images before printing them. If you don?t like what you see, edit them the way you want them or delete them. Digital photography doesn?t use the toxic chemicals that often end up flowing down the drain and into our streams, rivers, and lakes. No more waiting to finish a roll before processing it, or wasting unexposed film when you can?t wait.Digital cameras are becoming more than just cameras, some digital cameras are capable of capturing not only still photographs, but also sound and even video, they are becoming more like multimedia recorders than pure camerast. Digital photography is a new way to capture photos using a solid-state image sensor instead of traditional film. Once captured, the photos are then stored in a universal digital format that lets you move them to a computer, print them on a printer, view them on a television, e-mail them to friends, or even put them on the Web where anyone in the world can see them. Digital photography is becoming increasingly popular because of the flexibility it gives you when you want to use or distribute an image. It's both the immediacy and flexibility of digital imaging that's made is so popular in so many areas.  However, there is one aspect of digital photography that is rarely mentioned. This is the new freedom it gives you to explore photography.  We may not be carrying glass plates, but you and I also hesitate before taking a picture. We're always doing a mental calculation ""is it worth it"", subconsciously we're running down a checklist of costs, times, effort, and so on. During that ""decisive moment,"" the image is often lost or we fail to try new things. We lose the opportunity for creative growth.  And choose to stay in the familiar rut that's delivered for us in the past. If an image didn't turn out, or if he was out of glass plates, he could just scrape off the emulsion from an image he was willing to sacrifice, recoat the plate, and try again. Digital photography not only eliminates that nagging ""is it worth it"" question but it also returns us to that era of endlessly reusable film. Hand the camera to the kids, take weird and unusual angles, shoot without looking through the viewfinder, and ignore all previously held conceptions about how to take images. You may be surprised at the images you get if you exploit this new era of uninhibited shooting. "//

[photography, nature, beauty, feelings]. It is a major force in explaining man to man. [power]. We are a nation of photographers, with millions of film cameras in homes and a hugely growing market in digital photography, our lives and times are the most documented events in history. [photography, cameras, digital, documentation]. Magazines and newspapers have the capability of going to press with photos shot only moments earlier. [photos, media].

Photography archives our history, linking us to our past by creating a visual diary that defines us for future generations. [life, documentaion]. This simple box ties us to our past and connects us to our future. [time]. Pointandshoot cameras, known affectionately as PHD (push here, dummy) cameras, are mastering the once arcane task of exposure, producing consistent results. [cameras, phd, task]. Today�s generation is visually sophisticated, young people are bombarded with intelligent, wellcomposed, and compelling images hundreds of times a day. [effect, images, people]. To put a weak image in front of this audience is almost unforgivable. [image, people]. So why is it that most people�s photos lack the �oomph� that makes an image stick in your mind, if not become an icon. [people, photo, power]. In this chapter, I�ll talk about the power of photography and how it impacts our lives. [power, photography]. As well as how to become comfortable with the equipment and working with people, one of the most difficult areas for aspiring photographers. [equipment, mastering, people]. It�s like exercise, as a famous ad slogan says, Just do it, the first few times will be challenging, but soon it will become second nature. [practice]. Digital technology is one of the greatest tools ever to impact photography. [digital, technology, photography]. No longer do we have to wait hours, if not days, to see the results of our photographic endeavors. [time, results, photography]. The image appears instantly in the monitor, allowing us to check exposure, composition, and content. [image]. As photographers, we all try to work a situation to capture the decisive moment. [photography, moment]. To be able to check out images while you are still in the moment, not two days later when that moment is just a memory, facilitates better photography. [capture, image, moment, photography]. Another obvious advantage: no film costs, a great photojournalist and friend, Joe McNally, shot National Geographic�s first assigned digital story, �Aviation,� which ran in early 2004. [film, cost, digital, story]. I talked to Joe and he made the surprising comment that he actually shot less on this story than he would have on a filmbased shoot. [shooting, story, film]. Normally, Joe would have shot about 500 to 700 rolls of film on an assignment like this, digitally, he shot about 7500 images (the equivalent of about 200 rolls of film). [film, shooting].
