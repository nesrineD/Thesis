AMERICANS work some of the longest hours in the Western world, and many struggle to achieve a healthy balance between work and life. [balance,life,struggle]. As a result, there is an understandable tendency to assume that the problem we face is one of quantity. [problem]. We simply do not have enough free time. []. “If I could just get a few more hours off work each week,” you might think, “I would be happier”. [wish,work,time]. This may be true. []. But the situation, I believe, is more complicated than that. [situation,complexity]. As I discovered in a study that I published with my colleague Chaeyoon Lim in the journal Sociological Science, it’s not just that we have a shortage of free time; it’s also that our free time, in order to be satisfying, often must align with that of our friends and loved ones. [lack,time,alignment]. We face a problem, in other words, of coordination. [problem,coordination]. Work-life balance is not something that you can solve on your own. [work,life,balance]. Our study, which drew on data from more than 500,000 respondents to the Gallup Daily Poll, examined the day-to-day fluctuations and patterns in people’s emotions, week after week. [study,fluctuation,emotion]. Two facts about emotional well-being emerged — one that was intuitive, the other surprising. [facts,well-being]. The intuitive finding was that people’s feelings of well-being closely tracked the workweek. [feeling,track,workweek]. As measured by things such as anxiety, stress, laughter and enjoyment, our well-being is lowest Monday through Thursday. [well-being,emotions]. The workweek is a slog. [slog]. Well-being edges up on Friday, and really peaks on Saturday and Sunday. [well-being]. We are, in a real sense, living for the weekend. [living,well-being]. The surprising finding was that this is also true of unemployed people. [people,group,unemployment]. We found that the jobless showed almost exactly the same day-to-day pattern in emotional well-being as working people did. [well-being,emotions,work]. Their positive emotions soared on the weekend, and dropped back down again on Monday. [cycle,emotion]. It seems obvious why working people cherish the weekend:. [cherish,weekend]. It’s a respite from work. But why is the weekend also so important to the unemployed?. [importance,unemployed]. The key to answering this question is to recognize that not all time is equal. [time,equality,asnwer]. Time is, in many ways, what sociologists call a “network good”. [time,sociology,good]. Network goods are things that derive their value from being widely shared. [good,share,value]. Take your computer: Its value depends in large measure on how many other people also have a computer. [value,computer,people]. This is because you use your computer as, among other things, a communication technology:. [use,computer,communication]. for Internet access, email, Facebook and file sharing. [services]. When everyone you know has a computer, the technology is indispensable. [computer,technology,need]. But if you were the only person with a computer, its value would be limited. [limitation].
