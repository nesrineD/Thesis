Photography has become pervasive in our society. Each of us sees a lot of images every day. The vast majority of images are those taken for personal enjoyment. These images either capture the moment or provide a form of self expression. Many other images are used to lubricate the wheels of commerce. They appear in ads and on magazine covers and packages. Other images in magazines and newspapers are used to convey news or to make an editorial point. Digital photography doesnâ€™t use the toxic chemicals.
