Photography has become pervasive in our society. [photography, society]. Each of us sees hundreds, if not thousands, of images every day. [images, amount]. The vast majority of images are those taken for personal enjoyment. [images, pleasure]. These images either capture the moment or provide a form of self expression. [image, role]. Many other images are used to lubricate the wheels of commerce. [image, economy]. They appear in ads and on magazine covers and packages. [apparition, form]. Other images in magazines and newspapers are used to convey news or to make an editorial point. [media, opinion].  No matter what purpose images are put to, it is the images themselves that are transcendent. [purpose, image]. The way they have been captured is secondary. [capture].  However, changes in technology can open new opportunities and approaches that change the way images look. [image, advancement, technology, form]. For example, the introduction of the 35mm Leica made it easier to capture fast moving action and images became more spontaneous and fluid. [image, technology, quality]. The vast majority of the images you see are still captured with traditional cameras and film. [image, traditional, camera]. However, this is changing rapidly as digital cameras are accepted in more and more areas of photography. [digital, camera, photography, field]. Already they have made major inroads into catalog photography and photojournalism. [photography, field]. They are now well on their way to becoming a major factor in photography for self-expression. [photography, role]. In time, they are destined to dominate photography. [importance, photography]. Although photographic technology has changed dramatically since its invention in 1840, the principles of good images have remained fairly constant. [photography, technology, evolution, principles, images]. The images taken in 1840 by Henry Fox Talbot and Daguarre are as well composed and interesting as any images taken with the most modern equipment. [images, quality, equipment, comparison].  However, although technology doesn't make good images any easier to capture, it has made profound changes in others areas of photography. [technology, image, capture, photography, evolution]. Digital photography in particular has made it possible to capture an image and then instantly distribute it around the world. [digital, photography, image, time, distribution]. Digital photography has also closed the darkroom and opened up an entirely new way to edit and present images. [digital, photography, image, creation]. In this on-line book we explore photography in a very traditional way, but the emphasis is on modern technology from digital cameras, to digital darkrooms, to on-line publishing and sharing of images. [photography, technology, distribution]. This text provides an introduction to all aspects of the emerging world of digital photography. [guide, photography]. Starting with the camera and image capture, it then goes on the discuss image storage, transfer, editing, printing, and distribution. [image, workflow]. As you follow the path through the book you'll learn much about hardware, software, and procedures. [equipement, technologies]. In traditional courses the end result is usually a print and the darkroom experience of creating it. [traditional, photography, result, print]. In digital photography courses, a print is only one of many possible applications of a captured image. [digital, photography, result, print]. In many ways it's the least exciting aspect to students who are more oriented to the Internet and the possibilities it opens up to displaying and sharing images world-wide. [internet, images, distribution].  As a teacher, the digital approach also makes it easier to demonstrate techniques and procedures on a one-to-one basis. [approach , guide]. Once captured, digital photographs are already in a universal format that makes them incredibly easy to distribute and use. [digital, image, distibution]. You can insert digital photographs into word processing documents, send them by e-mail to friends, or post them on a Web site where anyone in the world can see them. [digital, image, distibution]. With many cameras you can immediately see your images on a small LCD screen, or you can connect the camera to a TV and show them much like a slide show. [camera, image, display]. Digital photography is instant photography without the film costs. [digital, photography, edit, cost]. You can also use a photo editing program such as Photoshop to improve or alter them. [editing, software]. Going digital saves you money in the long run by not buying rolls of film and paying for their development. [digital, photography, money]. Digital cameras instantly show you how your pictures look. [digital, camera, time, images]. You can view images before printing them. [image , view, print]. If you don’t like what you see, edit them the way you want them or delete them. [dislike, edit]. Digital photography doesn’t use the toxic chemicals that often end up flowing down the drain and into our streams, rivers, and lakes. [digital, photography, chemical]. No more waiting to finish a roll before processing it, or wasting unexposed film when you can’t wait. [film]. Some digital cameras are capable of capturing not only still photographs, but also sound and even video, they are becoming more like multimedia recorders than pure camerast. [digital, camera, capture, photograph, multimedia]. Digital photography is a new way to capture photos using a solid-state image sensor instead of traditional film. [digital, photography, photo]. The captured photos are then stored in a digital format that lets you move them to a computer, print them on a printer, view them on a television, e-mail them to friends, or even put them on the Web. [digital, photo, distribution, internet]. It's both the immediacy and flexibility of digital imaging that's made is so popular in so many areas. [digital, image, advantage]. However, there is one aspect of digital photography that is rarely mentioned. [digital, photography, aspect]. This is the new freedom it gives you to explore photography. [photography, advantage]. During that "decisive moment," the image is often lost or we fail to try new things. [capture, instant, failure]. Hand the camera to the kids, take weird and unusual angles, shoot without looking through the viewfinder, and ignore all previously held conceptions about how to take images. [camera, capture]. You may be surprised at the images you get if you exploit this new era of uninhibited shooting. [image, shoot].
