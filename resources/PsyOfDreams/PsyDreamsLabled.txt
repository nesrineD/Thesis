In what we may term "prescientific days" people were in no uncertainty about the interpretation of dreams. [history, dreams, interpretation]. When they were recalled after awakening they were regarded as either the friendly or hostile manifestation of some higher powers, demoniacal and divine. [dreams, recall, myth]. With the rise of scientific thought the whole of this expressive mythology was transferred to psychology. [dreams, science, psychology]. Today there is but a small minority among educated persons who doubt that the dream is the dreamer's own psychical act. [dreams, psyche, belief]. But since the downfall of the mythological hypothesis an interpretation of the dream has been wanting. [dreams, interpretation]. The conditions of its origin, its relationship to our psychical life when we are awake seem to compel notice. [dreams, origin, psychology, sleep]. Its many peculiarities repugnant to our waking thought, the way in which, on awakening, our thoughts thrust it aside as something bizarre, and our reminiscences mutilating or rejecting it. [dreams, thought, waking, feeling]. All these and many other problems have for many hundred years demanded answers which up till now could never have been satisfactory. [problems, answers]. Before all there is the question as to the meaning of the dream. [dreams, question, meaning]. Firstly, the psychical significance of the dream, its position with regard to the psychical processes, as to a possible biological function. [dreams, psychology, meaning]. Secondly, has the dream a meaning, can sense be made of each single dream as of other mental syntheses. [dream, meaning, mental]. Three tendencies can be observed in the estimation of dreams. [dreams, estimation, tendencies]. Many philosophers have given currency to one of these tendencies, one which at the same time preserves something of the dream's former over valuation. [philosopher, tendency]. The foundation of dream life is for them a peculiar state of psychical activity, which they even celebrate as elevation to some higher state. [dream, psyche, state]. Schubert claims that the dream is the liberation of the spirit from the pressure of external nature, a detachment of the soul from the fetters of matter. [dream, spirit, freedom]. Many maintain that dreams have their origin in real spiritual excitations, and are the outward manifestations of spiritual powers whose free movements have been hampered during the day. [dreams, reality, manifestaion]. A large number of observers acknowledge that dream life is capable of extraordinary achievements, in certain fields. [dreams, achievement]. The majority of medical writers hardly admit that the dream is a psychical phenomenon at all. [dreams, medicine, view]. According to them dreams are provoked and initiated exclusively by stimuli proceeding from the senses or the body, which either reach the sleeper from without or are accidental disturbances of his internal organs. [dreams, medicine, stimuli, material]. The dream has no greater claim to meaning and importance than the sound called forth by the ten fingers of a person quite unacquainted with music running his fingers over the keys of an instrument. [dreams, similarity, music]. The dream is to be regarded, as a physical process always useless, frequently morbid. [dream, illness]. All the peculiarities of dream life are explicable as the incoherent effort, due to some physiological stimulus, of certain organs, or of the cortical elements of a brain otherwise asleep. [dream, characteristics, meaning, stimuli, organ]. The popular view holds firmly to the belief that dreams really have got a meaning, in some way they do foretell the future, whilst the meaning can be unravelled in some way or other from its oft bizarre and enigmatical content. [dream, meaning, content]. The reading of dreams consists in replacing the events of the dream, so far as remembered, by other events. [dreams, event, replacement]. This is done either scene by scene, according to some rigid key, or the dream as a whole is replaced by something else of which it was a symbol. [dream, explanation, scenes, symbol]. One day I discovered to my amazement that the popular view grounded in superstition, and not the medical one, comes nearer to the truth about dreams. [dreams, view, myth]. I arrived at new conclusions about dreams by the use of a new method of psychological investigation, one which had rendered me good service in the investigation of phobias, obsessions and illusions. [dreams, investigation, psychology]. The manifold analogies of dream life with the most diverse conditions of psychical disease in the waking state have been rightly insisted upon by a number of medical observers. [similarity, dream, reality, medicine]. It seemed, therefore, a priori, hopeful to apply to the interpretation of dreams methods of investigation which had been tested in psychopathological processes. [interpretation, dreams, approach, psychopathology]. A series of dream problems which have intensely occupied older authors will be laid aside when the old opposition between conscious life and dream life is abandoned and the unconscious psychic assigned to its proper place. [dream, investigation, unconsciousness]. Thus many of the activities whose performances in the dream have excited our admiration are now no longer to be attributed to the dream but to unconscious thinking, which is also active during the day. [dream, unconsciousness, thinking]. The dream seems to play with a symboling representation of the body. [dream, symbole]. This is the work of certain unconscious phantasies and that these phantasies come to expression not only in dreams but also in hysterical phobias and in other symptoms. [unconsciousness, phantasies, manifestation, dream phobia]. We are probably far too much inclined to over estimate the conscious character even of intellectual and artistic productions. [conscious, character, estimation]. From the communications of some of the most highly productive persons, we learn, that the most essential and original parts in their creations came to them in the form of inspirations. [intellectual, inspiration]. There is nothing strange about the assistance of the conscious activity in other cases where there was a concerted effort of all the psychic forces. [conscious, psyche].
