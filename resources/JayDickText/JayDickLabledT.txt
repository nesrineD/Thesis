Photography records the gamut of feelings written on the human face, the beauty of the earth and skies that man has inherited, and the wealth and confusion man has created. [photography, nature, beauty, feelings]. It is a major force in explaining man to man. [power]. We are a nation of photographers, with millions of film cameras in homes and a hugely growing market in digital photography, our lives and times are the most documented events in history. [photography, cameras, digital, documentation]. Magazines and newspapers have the capability of going to press with photos shot only moments earlier. [photos, media]. Television newscasts use viewers’ digital images, sent in via the Internet, with photos ranging from news events, to weather photos, to beautiful sunsets. [digital, photos, images, media]. We send our relatives electronic photo albums of our vacation or the baby’s first year. [digital, photos, family]. We now have the ability to produce highquality books containing photos and text at the click of a mouse and at a nexttonothing cost. [books, photos, cost]. Not only are we a nation of photographers, but we’re a nation of digital technology. [photography, digital, technology]. Photography archives our history, linking us to our past by creating a visual diary that defines us for future generations. [photography, life, documentaion].

Pointandshoot cameras, known affectionately as PHD (push here, dummy) cameras, are mastering the once arcane task of exposure, producing consistent results. [phd, cameras, task]. Today’s generation is visually sophisticated, young people are bombarded with intelligent, wellcomposed, and compelling images hundreds of times a day. [images, power, people]. To put a weak image in front of this audience is almost unforgivable. [image, people]. So why is it that most people’s photos lack the effect that makes an image stick in your mind, if not become an icon. [people, image, impact]. In this chapter, I’ll talk about the power of photography and how it impacts our lives. [power, photography, impact]. As well as how to become comfortable with the equipment and working with people, one of the most difficult areas for aspiring photographers. [equipment, mastering, people]. It’s like exercise, as a famous ad slogan says, Just do it, the first few times will be challenging, but soon it will become second nature. [practice]. Digital technology is one of the greatest tools ever to impact photography. [digital, technology, impact, photography]. No longer do we have to wait hours, if not days, to see the results of our photographic endeavors. [time, results, photography]. The image appears instantly in the monitor, allowing us to check exposure, composition, and content. [image, time]. As photographers, we all try to work a situation to capture the decisive moment. [photographer, capture, instant]. To be able to check out images while you are still in the moment, not two days later when that moment is just a memory, facilitates better photography. [capture, image, instant, photography]. Another obvious advantage: no film costs, a great photojournalist shot National Geographic’s first assigned digital story, “Aviation” . [film, cost, digital, story]. He made the surprising comment that he actually shot less on this story than he would have on a filmbased shoot. [shooting, comparison, story, film]. Normally, he would have shot about 500 to 700 rolls of film on an assignment like this, digitally, he shot about 7500 images (the equivalent of about 200 rolls of film). [film, shooting, number].
